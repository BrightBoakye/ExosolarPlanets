# ExosolarPlanets
This is a python code for finding Exoplanets.
This code for example uses a computer simulation of an exoplanet passing in front of a star out of our solar system.
Detection works when the planet dims the light intensity of the star as it passes in front it.(Transit.py)
Python Code for detecting Alien Warships in transit in front of another star(AlienWarShips.py)
